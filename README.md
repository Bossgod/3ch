#Saguaro Imageboard

<i>A branch of ye olden futallaby-plus, which was a branch of futallaby, which was a branch/translation of futaba which was...</i><hr>	

This has been cobbled together from stuff I myself have written and the contributions of others, named in the line I copied and pasted from the old readme just below this one:		
<i>"Special thanks to !KNs1o0VDv6, Glas, Anonymous from vchan, RePod, and anyone who actually uses this."</i>		

#Installing
Extract everything from the zip and put it in the directory of your choosing. Edit config.php and run imgboard.php once to generate the page. If the config file is set up correctly, Saguaro should do the rest for you.

#Setting up multiple boards
Set up multiple boards by creating new directories and placing the files in it. Boards can share the same SQL database (SQLDB), but not the same table (SQLLOG). 
SQLBANLOG should be the same value for all boards to ensure board-based banning functions properly.

#jQuery suite
Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/repod">RePod</a> in particular for sticking around and later providing the <a href="https://github.com/RePod/Saguaro-jquery">jquery suite</a> for the board.		
Speaking of the <a href="https://github.com/RePod/Saguaro-jquery">jquery suite</a>, that's the part of the board that will/should be updated the most often, so head over to that repo and get your real updates.<hr>		
#Support
If you'd like to contact me, shoot me an email, otherwise if you have general support questions that you'd like a semi-live response to, feel free to try the IRC channel which is #saguaroimgboard @ irc.rizon.net		
No guarantees that I'll be online or helpful, though.
